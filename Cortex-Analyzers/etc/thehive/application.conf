# TheHive configuration - application.conf
#
#
# This is the default configuration file.
# This is prepared to run with all services locally:
# - Cassandra for the database
# - Elasticsearch for index engine
# - File storage is local in /opt/thp/thehive/files
#
# If this is not your setup, please refer to the documentation at:
# https://docs.strangebee.com/thehive/
#
#
# Secret key - used by Play Framework
# If TheHive is installed with DEB/RPM package, this is automatically generated
# If TheHive is not installed from DEB or RPM packages run the following
# command before starting thehive:
#   cat > /etc/thehive/secret.conf << _EOF_
#   play.http.secret.key="$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 64 |#   head -n 1)"
#   _EOF_

# Additional modules

# TheHive is strongly integrated with Cortex and MISP.
# Both modules are enabled by default. If not used, each one can be disabled by
